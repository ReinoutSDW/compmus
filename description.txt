I found both songs on a YouTube channel called BORNEO. I sometimes DJ, and my usual set starts off with rally house (reinout-w-1) and gradually flows into trance (reinout-w-2). I was looking for royalty hard house at first, but couldn't find so. Then I started looking for royalty free trance, and BORNEO showed up. On his page, I found both songs.
